## ðŸ“– About

- **Goal**: Solve and document **one** LeetCode problem **per day** for sustained DSA mastery.  
- **Language**: Java (with clean, commented code).  
- **Approach**:  
  1. Read and analyze the prompt thoroughly.  
  2. Sketch out data structures and algorithmic approach.  
  3. Implement solution in a dedicated Java class.  
  4. Add explanation and time/space complexity in comments.  
  5. Write and run test cases for validation.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure


- **`daily-solutions/`**: Each file is named `<YYYY-MM-DD>_<ProblemName>.java`  
- **`tests/`**: JUnit test suite that runs through sample/custom tests.  
- **`utils/`**: Shared helpers (I/O, assertions).

## ðŸ›  Daily Challenge Workflow

1. **Create** a new Java class from the template in `daily-solutions/template/`.  
2. **Rename** file to `YYYY-MM-DD_<ProblemName>.java`.  
3. **Implement** solution with:
   - Clear method signature.
   - In-code comments for logic steps.
   - Analysis of time & space complexity.
4. **Write** test cases in `tests/DailySolutionTests.java`.  
5. **Commit & Push**:
   ```bash
   git add daily-solutions/2025-08-02_*.java tests/DailySolutionTests.java
   git commit -m "Solve [LeetCode #<ID>] <ProblemName> â€” YYYY-MM-DD"
   git push
